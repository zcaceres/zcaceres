# Hey! 👋 I'm Zach and I love building things.

I'm a software engineer and the entrepreneur behind projects like [Startup Cities](https://perma.cc/BGG5-HBXW) 🌆 and [the MPC, an experimental college 🎓](https://mpc.ufm.edu/) in Guatemala City..

I've been an early engineer in startups including [Curology](https://www.curology.com), [Clay](https://www.clay.run), and [AskLorem](https://www.asklorem.com). I also built the platform to support the climate change non-profit [Makesoil.org](https://www.makesoil.org). I also published the video game [Escape Dead Earth](https://www.escapedeadearth.com). I maintain an active consulting practice where I've built solutions that bridge Deep Learning and web technologies. Currently I'm a Senior Software engineer at Curology and working on [a project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOIDnNA9N7c) to connect the workflow of a productive software engineer to modern findings neuroscience.
