# Hey! 👋 I'm Zach and I love building things.

I'm a software engineer and the entrepreneur behind projects like [Startup Cities](https://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/startup-cities-can-entrepreneurship-save-politics) 🌆 and [an experimental college 🎓 named the MPC](https://mpc.ufm.edu/).

I've also been an early engineer in a few startups including [Clay](https://www.clay.run) and [AskLorem](https://www.asklorem.com).
